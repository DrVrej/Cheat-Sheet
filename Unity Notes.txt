Scenes = Basically maps
	- Only one can be active at a time, but you can make a transition between scenes using code
   
Scripts:
	- Script must be in the hierarchy or attached to object for it to run (Leaving it in the asset folder will do nothing as far as I know?)
	- public variables will appear in the inspector
	- private variables will NOT appear in the inspector
		- [SerializeField] = Private variables that can be viewed/edited inside the object's inspector
   
	- Object = The base class for all objects in Unity. It offers instantiation and destruction functions, but not much more.
	- GameObject = Subclass of Object, its the base class for all entities in a scene. It has a Transform component by default and can have other components attached.
		- gameObject = Can be accessed from component objects, for example "transform.gameObject", this is useful if you only have the "transform" object and want to access the object that holds it.
